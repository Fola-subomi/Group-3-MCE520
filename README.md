This project focuses on building an image classification model using deep learning to distinguish between wooden shapes—specifically circles and rectangles. The model is trained on a custom dataset of images captured and uploaded to Google Drive. Using Google Colab as the development environment, the images were preprocessed for consistency in size, format, and quality.
The classification task was implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the EfficientNetV2 architecture, which is known for its accuracy and computational efficiency. This report outlines the steps taken—from pre
